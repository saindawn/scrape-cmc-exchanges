# CoinMarketCap Exchange Data Scraper

## Overview

This program scrapes data from the CoinMarketCap exchange rankings page and exports it to a CSV file. The data includes exchange name, trade volume over the last 24 hours, average liquidity, weekly visits, number of markets, and number of coins listed.

## Features

- Headless web scraping using Selenium.
- Data extraction from CoinMarketCapâ€™s exchange rankings.
- Robust error handling and logging.
- Automatic retries in case of timeouts.
- Can be used for Daily Extraction Scrape data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
- pytz

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pytz
   ```
3. Ensure you have the Chrome WebDriver installed and available in your system PATH. You can download it from here.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python cmc_exch_scraper.py
```

The program will create a CSV file named exchanges*information*<formatted_timestamp>.csv in the data directory with the scraped information.

## Logging

All logs will be stored in `logfile.log`. This file will contain information about the scraping process, including any errors encountered.

## Error Handling

The script implements a retry mechanism for handling `TimeoutException`. It will retry up to 3 times with a 15-second delay between attempts if a timeout occurs

## Notes

- The script is designed to run headlessly. If you want to see the browser in action, remove the chrome_option.add_argument("--headless") line from the setup_driver function.
- Adjust the implicit wait and scroll settings as needed based on the speed of your internet connection and the responsiveness of the CoinMarketCap site.
